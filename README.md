## Autocomplete

Project done for an upper-level CSC course. Shows a list of matches for a search, much like google. This was made using [the algs4 library](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/).

## Usage
Best run with the GUI. Arguments are the text file you wish to search, and the number of autocompleted searches
you would like to see. So the arguments pokemon.txt 10 would show up to 10 options from the text file that match the search. Capitalization does matter here.
